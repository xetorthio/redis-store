# Redis Store

This is a Redis Store for tomcat sessions. It uses Jedis (http://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) as the Redis Client.

## How do I use it?

You can download the latests build at: 
    http://github.com/xetorthio/RedisStore/downloads

You must copy the jar into the lib folder of your tomcat installation directory, then edit your conf/server.xml file and within your context tag add the following lines:

	<Manager className="org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManager" saveOnRestart="true" maxActiveSessions="1" minIdleSwap="1" maxIdleSwap="1" maxIdleBackup="1">
    	<Store className="org.apache.catalina.session.RedisStore" 
    		host="localhost"
    		port="6379"
    		password="something"
    		database="0"
    	/>
    </Manager>
	
You can play with the values. This is just an example.

Make sure that whatever you store in the session is Serializable.

## How to add connection pooling capabilities?

By default the connection pooling is disabled. You can improve the performance using the following:

	<Manager className="org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManager" saveOnRestart="true" maxActiveSessions="1" minIdleSwap="1" maxIdleSwap="1" maxIdleBackup="1">
    	<Store className="org.apache.catalina.session.RedisStore"
    		host="localhost"
    		port="6379"
    		password="something"
    		database="0"
    		usePool="true"
    	/>
    </Manager>

If you want (and know how) tuning the connection pool, only set the according parameters and values according to the Jedis documentation (https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/wiki/Getting-started)
